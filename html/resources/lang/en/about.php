            <p>Service, where participants pay in their items (skins), and when we have 100 skins in total the system randomly determines one winner, who gets all deposited items. The winner is determined randomly, the chance to win depends on the cost of skins you deposited.</p>

            <h2>The principle is simple</h2>

            <p>The more items you bet and the more expensive they are, the more is the chance that you will get a jackpot!<br>Even if you invest just 20 rubles, you get a chance to win a jackpot!</p>

                <div class="item left margin">
                    <div class="step-number">1</div>
                    <p>You add you items via the "Participate" button, which sends Trade to our bot. You can bet maximum of 15 skins at once, all together worth not less than 20 rubles.</p>

                    <p>The deposited items are transferred into points, based on their price. For each kopeck of the price of an item you get 1 ticket (1r - 1 ticket). Your chance to win depends on the number of tickets.</p>

                    <p>After reaching the threshold of 100 skins, we collect all issued points and randomly determine one winner. However, the priority goes to those participants, who have more points than others do.</p>

        <li>Maximum deposit - 15 items per trade. There is no upper limit of the price of an item, you deposit will be accepted if the total price of all items is not less than 20 rubles.</li>
        <li>If you add items to the pool as the last deposit, and the counter will pass the specified threshold, the items will be reviewed as deposited for the current round, because the user added items to participate in the current and not in the previous round.</li>

        <li>Deposit and withdrawal of the prize pool happens very quick (up to 5 minutes)</li>
        <li>Every time you send your items, you agree with the Terms and Conditions of this website.</li>
        <li>If your inventory is close and bot was not able to send you the prize, it will not repeat the process. The bot is not designed to resend items.
